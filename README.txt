Gives you ultimate controll over which image metadata WordPress extracts from an uploaded image
and where and in what form it then goes.

== Description ==

When you upload an image in the WordPress admin, WordPress extracts the **EXIF ImageDescription** metadata to the 
**Description** field and the **IPTC Headline** to the **Title** field of
the form that gets displayed after the image has been uploaded.

The **Image Metadata Cruncher** plugin lets you choose what metadata will be extracted from the uploaded image and
in which fields of the form they appear.

Moreover, the plugin's simple templating system allows you to prefill the form with complex strings like
*Image was taken with Canon 7D, exposure was 1/125s and aperture was f/2.8*.

You can even specify custom **post meta** that will be saved with the image to the database.

== Installation ==

Copy the **image-metadata-cruncher** folder into the plugins directory and activate.
